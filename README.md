To achieve this certification, we are working on Capstone Project to predict Marine incident using publicly available data from-
https://www.marad.dot.gov/resources/data-statistics/
 
Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE)
Marine Casualty and Pollution Database, July 6, 2015

In this dataset we have three types of incident data - casualty, pollution and event. Our initial plan was we will work with all incident data and integrate with Marine AIS (Automatic Identification System) data
to show the location where most incident happen that Marine authority make their strategic plan based on prediction.

But due to time constraint and after lots of experimentation on ArcGIS, PostGIG, QGIS etc. and also after discussing with project coordinator (Tony Odeja) we narrowed down our project scope. 
But this not the end, we eager to continue these challenges after completion of this academic program.
